# Questions for the User Study

## Background

1. How much experience do you have with Machine Learning: in years?

2. How much programming of Machine Learning Models do you do?

## Main

Have you ever heard of Machine Learning Backdoors?

Backdoors are small modifications to otherwise benign networks to respond to an attacker-defined trigger. For example, a backdoored network for digit classification may classify a dotted 3 as a 9.

I'm going to show you some more models. Some of these models will contain backdoors: malware embedded into the model itself causing it to perform badly if a particular "trigger" is present in an input image.

## Section 1

We're going to do 5 questions. For each question, I'm going to show you two models and I'd like you to have a very quick look at each of the models for ≤ 1 minute each and say which you'd rather use and why.

### Question 1

With 1 as being unaware of the architecture, 2 as being familiar with the main features and 3 as being familiar with it at a code-level; how familiar are you with **model 1** / **model 2**?

- Have a quick look at **model 1** (for ≤ 1 minute).

- Have a quick look at the **model 2** (for ≤ 1 minute).

Which would you rather use and what's your reasoning for that?



### Question 2

With 1 as being unaware of the architecture, 2 as being familiar with the main features and 3 as being familiar with it at a code-level; how familiar are you with **model 1** / **model 2**?

- Have a quick look at **model 1** (for ≤ 1 minute).

- Have a quick look at **model 2** (for ≤ 1 minute).

Which would you rather use and what's your reasoning for that?

### Question 3

With 1 as being unaware of the architecture, 2 as being familiar with the main features and 3 as being familiar with it at a code-level; how familiar are you with **model 1** / **model 2**?

- Have a quick look at **model 1** (for ≤ 1 minute).

- Have a quick look at **model 2** (for ≤ 1 minute).

Which would you rather use and what's your reasoning for that?

### Question 4

With 1 as being unaware of the architecture, 2 as being familiar with the main features and 3 as being familiar with it at a code-level; how familiar are you with **model 1** / **model 2** ?

- Have a quick look at **model 1** (for ≤ 1 minute).

- Have a quick look at **model 2** (for ≤ 1 minute).

Which would you rather use and what's your reasoning for that?

### Question 5

With 1 as being unaware of the architecture, 2 as being familiar with the main features and 3 as being familiar with it at a code-level; how familiar are you with **model 1** / **model 2** ?

- Have a quick look at **model 1** (for ≤ 1 minute).

- Have a quick look at **model 2** (for ≤ 1 minute).

Which would you rather use and what's your reasoning for that?

## Section 2

We're going to do 5 more questions. For each question, I'm going to show you a network and I'd like you to have a two minute look through the network and point out anything (at most 3 things) which you think is suspicious.

### Question 1

How familiar are you with **model**?
- [ ] Not at all
- [ ] Aware of the main features
- [ ] Familiar with it at a code-level

Have a quick look (≤ 2 minutes) through the model for 2 minutes. I'd like you to look for anything suspicious.



### Question 2

How familiar are you with **model**?
- [ ] Not at all
- [ ] Aware of the main features
- [ ] Familiar with it at a code-level

Have a quick look (≤ 2 minutes) through the model for 2 minutes. I'd like you to look for anything suspicious.



### Question 3

How familiar are you with **model**?
- [ ] Not at all
- [ ] Aware of the main features
- [ ] Familiar with it at a code-level

Have a quick look (≤ 2 minutes) through the model for 2 minutes. I'd like you to look for anything suspicious.
